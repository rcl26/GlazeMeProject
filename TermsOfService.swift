                Welcome to Cap Call ("we," "our," or "us"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Cap Call mobile application ("App") and associated services ("Services"). By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to comply with these Terms.

                If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App or Services.

                1. Eligibility
                You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. By using the App, you represent and warrant that you meet this requirement.

                2. Account Registration
                - You must create an account to access certain features.

                3. Subscription and Payments
                - Access to certain features requires a subscription. All payments are processed via Apple's In-App Purchase (IAP) system.
                - Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the billing cycle.
                - All sales are final, and no refunds, free trials, or discounts are offered.

                - By uploading images to the App, you confirm that you have obtained all necessary permissions and consents from any identifiable individuals featured in the images. This includes ensuring compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations.
                - You agree not to upload content that violates laws, infringes upon third-party rights, or is deemed inappropriate or offensive.
                - Although the App utilizes Google Vision API's SafeSearch and other automated filtering systems, we do not guarantee that all inappropriate content will be detected or blocked. You acknowledge that the accuracy of such systems is limited, and you are responsible for reviewing all outputs before use.
                - You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless against any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from your use of the App, including the misuse of captions, images, or lack of necessary consents.

                - Reverse-engineer or tamper with the App's functionality.
                - Attempt to bypass payment systems or subscription requirements.

                6. Data Retention and Account Deletion
                - Uploaded images and personal content are deleted immediately upon account deletion.
                - Minimal data, such as payment records and compliance logs, may be retained securely for up to 180 days, per Firebaseâ€™s data retention practices.

                - By using the App, you agree to the terms and data practices of these third-party services.

                8. Disclaimer of Warranties
                - The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.
                - We do not guarantee the accuracy of captions or uninterrupted availability of the App.

                9. Limitation of Liability
                To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App.
